# For Compose Wear
decompose-router-wear = { module = "io.github.xxfast:decompose-router-wear", version.ref = "decompose-router" }

# You will need to also bring in decompose and essenty
decompose = { module = "com.arkivanov.decompose:decompose", version.ref = "decompose" }
decompose-compose-multiplatform = { module = "com.arkivanov.decompose:extensions-compose-jetbrains", version.ref = "decompose" }
